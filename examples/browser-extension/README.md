## Features

- Chrome Manifest v3 extension
- RFC 9421 compatible `Signature` header
- CRX extension server

## Configuration

### Signature-Agent Header (Optional)

To use this extension with Cloudflare's verified bots program, you need to configure the `signature-Agent` header https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/reference/bot-verification/web-bot-auth/#43-construct-the-required-headers

```export SIGNATURE_AGENT_URL=https://yourdomain.com```

## Usage

Compile the code of the extension:

```shell
npm run build:chrome
```

Bundle and sign the Chrome extension:

```shell
npm run bundle:chrome
```

This command creates the folder `dist` with both the unpacked and packed (.crx) Chrome extension.

## Installing Extension from Sources

This extension requires the [webRequestBlocking](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/webRequest) permission, which in turn requires of an [Enterprise policy](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/187202?hl=en) to be configured on Chrome.

Follow these steps to configure Chrome with such a policy and force it to install the extension locally.
First, run in another terminal:

```shell
npm run start:config
```

This starts a server at http://localhost:8000 for installing extension locally.

Then, copy the policy file in the correspondent system path:

On Linux:

```shell
mkdir -p /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed
cp policy/policy.json /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/policy.json
```

On MacOS:

```shell
mkdir -p /Library/Managed\ Preferences/
cp policy/com.google.Chrome.managed.plist /Library/Managed\ Preferences/
```

You can confirm the policy is installed by navigating to `chrome://policy` and make sure to reload the policies.

## Debugging the Extension

Extensions installed by an Enterprise policy do not enable the DevTools by default. To enable the DevTools, open the system's policy file and add the following entry:

```
"DeveloperToolsAvailability": 1
```

Once the new policy takes effect, you can navigate to `chrome://extensions` where you should see an `Inspect views` label in the extension's box,
and a `service worker` link on the right of the label. Clicking the link will open the DevTools of the extension. If the link is absent,
try reloading the policy under `chrome://policy`.
